## Status

[![Generic badge](https://badgen.net/badge/ADR/proposed/orange/)](https://github.com/uktrade/trade-remedies-api/adr/README.md)

## Context

An ADR is our place to document past decisions and propose new ones. It is
beneficial to track the motivation behind certain decisions. ADRs help a
team to:

- Review _why_ things were done in a particular way. Should the team
  choose to supersede or deprecate a decision, it can be done in an informed
  manner.
- Maintain a consistent approach across projects.
- Ensure _architecturally significant_ design decisions are not whimsical,
  are well researched, justified and the subject of peer review.
- Be transparent in their decision-making process.

## Decision

We will document _architecturally significant_ decisions with an ADR, an
approach is inspired by
[Michael Nygard's article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

The workflow will be as [described here](README). Additionally,

## Consequences

1. Peer review of architecturally significant decisions.
2. Version-controlled documentation of architecturally significant
   decisions that can be used to inform new decisions.
3. Version-controlled documentation detailing why a design decision
   was rejected.
3. Version-controlled documentation detailing why a design decision
   was deprecated ot superseded.
5. Version-controlled documentation of architecturally significant
   decisions that provide decision-making transparency.
6. Improved consistency with respect to other projects.
